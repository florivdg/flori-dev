Astro provides a fantastic developer experience for building sites and applications with server-side rendering (SSR). For a [side project](https://github.com/florivdg/quadranto-cloud) I chose **Astro** and **Vue.js** to get started quickly. When I started this project, I was building my Docker images manually and pushing new versions to Docker Hub by hand. But it was definitely time for a change. **Enter GitHub Actions.**

In this guide, you'll learn how I use GitHub Actions to **build, package, and push** my Bun-powered Astro SSR application to the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). Let's dive in.

## Quick Recap: Why Astro SSR and Bun?

Astro's server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities allow your applications to handle **dynamic content, authentication, and database interactions** beyond the typical static page generation (yes, you can build things other than blogs with Astro üòú). Combined with Bun - a blazingly fast JavaScript runtime and package manager - I was off to a great start.

While it got me up and running quickly, building, tagging and pushing new versions by hand started to get really annoying. When it's time to deploy, we want efficiency, minimal downtime, and easy scalability. That's where Docker and GitHub Actions come in.

## Diving Into GitHub Actions for Docker-Based Deployment

GitHub Actions allows us to automate deployment processes in a simple, declarative workflow. Here's how we'll set this up for an Astro SSR app built with Bun:

### Overview of our GitHub Actions Workflow

We'll create a GitHub Action **workflow** that triggers when we push a new **release tag** (like `v1.0.0`). Our workflow does the following:

- Checks out the latest code.
- Builds a Docker image optimized for Astro SSR with Bun.
- Publishes the image to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) tagged with the version and `latest`.

Below is our **full GitHub Action YAML** configuration:

```yaml wrap
# .github/workflows/docker-publish.yml
name: Docker Publish

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Extract tag name
        id: extract_tag
        run: echo "tag=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Log in to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Set up QEMU
        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
        with:
          driver: docker-container

      - name: Build and Push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
          tags: |
            ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/astro-ssr-app:${{ steps.extract_tag.outputs.tag }}
            ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/astro-ssr-app:latest
          outputs: type=image,name=target,annotation-index.org.opencontainers.image.description=Organize your projects with the Eisenhower matrix.
```

## Understanding the Key Steps

Let's break down what's happening in the workflow **step-by-step.**

### Checkout Code

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

We begin by **pulling in the latest code** of your Astro application from GitHub. This ensures all Docker build steps have access to a fresh snapshot of your repository.

### Extracting the Version Tag

```yaml wrap
- name: Extract tag name
  id: extract_tag
  run: echo "tag=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

This step automatically **extracts the version number from the pushed tag**, simplifying versioning for your Docker images.

### Logging into GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

```yaml wrap
- name: Log in to GitHub Container Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v2
  with:
    registry: ghcr.io
    username: ${{ github.actor }}
    password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Securely **authenticate with GitHub Container Registry** to prepare for pushing your Docker images.

<Note>
  **‚òùÔ∏è Good To Know:** Your `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is provided automatically by
  GitHub Actions‚Äîno additional setup is needed!
</Note>

### Docker Buildx and QEMU for Multi-Platform Support

```yaml wrap
- name: Set up QEMU
  uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2

- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
  with:
    driver: docker-container
```

These steps enable building Docker images for multiple architectures (like `amd64` or `arm64`). This ensures the Docker image **runs on multiple platforms** like ARM-based web servers as well as traditional x86 servers or - if needed - macOS or Windows machines.

### Building and Pushing the Image

```yaml wrap
- name: Build and Push Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
    tags: |
      ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/astro-ssr-app:${{ steps.extract_tag.outputs.tag }}
      ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/astro-ssr-app:latest
    outputs: type=image,name=target,annotation-index.org.opencontainers.image.description=Organize your projects with the Eisenhower matrix.
```

This tells Docker to **build and push** your image, **tagging it** with both the specific version and the `latest` tag. The `annotation-index` contains **descriptive metadata** that makes your image more discoverable and maintainable.

<Note>
  **‚òùÔ∏è Attention:** Make sure to set `permissions: packages: write` in order to
  allow the workflow to write to the underlying Docker registry!
</Note>

## Deploying your Image

With your Docker images securely published to GitHub Container Registry, deploying the image to your hosting provider or infrastructure (such as your own VPS) becomes straightforward.

For example, simply pull your newly built image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/your-github-username/astro-ssr-app:latest
```

## Wrap-Up and Considerations

Deploying your Astro SSR applications should be as much fun as building them - and using GitHub Actions alongside Docker and Bun makes that a reality. This powerful automated workflow lets you iterate quickly, build multi-architecture images reliably, and ensure each release is smooth and secure.
