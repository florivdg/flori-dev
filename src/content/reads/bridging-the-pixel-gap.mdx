As an AI and especially Midjourney enthusiast, I've often faced the challenge of limited resolution in AI-generated images. Text-to-image generators are popular these days, but often suffer from limited resolution due to computational constraints. Resizing these generated images for high-resolution displays can result in a loss of detail and visual quality. And I love visual quality! üòç

To overcome this hurdle, I discovered a fantastic open source AI tool called [Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl).
