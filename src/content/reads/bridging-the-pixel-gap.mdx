As an AI and especially Midjourney enthusiast, I've often faced the challenge of limited resolution in AI-generated images. Text-to-image generators are popular these days, but often suffer from limited resolution due to computational constraints. Resizing these generated images for high-resolution displays can result in a loss of detail and visual quality. And I love visual quality! üòç

To overcome this hurdle, I discovered a fantastic open source AI tool called [Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl).

## What is Upscayl?

Upscayl is a free and open source AI image upscaler. The cross-platform application requires a Vulkan-compatible GPU for image upscaling, as some CPUs and integrated GPUs may not be compatible. Upscayl can upscale medium, low, and even super low resolution images, providing users with a reliable and easy-to-use image upscaling tool. It runs flawlessly on my Apple M1 Studio Mac.

## My Favorite Upscaling Types in Upscayl

In my journey of upscaling AI-generated images, I've found three primary upscaling types within the open source Upscayl software that have proven to be particularly effective:

### General Photo (REAL ESRGAN)

This type of upscaling is an excellent starting point for photorealistic artwork. Utilizing the power of _REAL ESRGAN_, this option manages to preserve fine details and produce high-quality upscaled images in most cases. Whenever I work with photorealistic AI art, I tend to use this option as my go-to upscaling method. However it's important to note that _REAL ESRGAN_ can sometimes sharpen too much detail in the background, which can result in unwanted artifacts.

### General Photo (Ultramix Balanced)

This type of upscaling is particularly useful when dealing with depth of field, especially in cartoonish artwork. _Ultramix Balanced_ has the unique ability to preserve depth information in images, resulting in more visually appealing and accurate results. Whenever I work with cartoonish art or need to preserve depth information in general, I choose this upscaling method because _REAL ESRGAN_ tends to sharpen too much detail in the background.

### Digital Art

When it comes to flat 2D illustrations or 3D renderings that require an extra sharp look, the _Digital Art_ upscaling type in Upscayl works wonders. It can effectively improve image quality without introducing unwanted artifacts, ensuring that the final result stays true to the original design. Whenever I work with 2D illustrations or 3D renders, this is my preferred upscaling option.
