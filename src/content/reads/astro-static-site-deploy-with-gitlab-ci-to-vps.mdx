Deploying a static site can be straightforward‚Äîuntil you realize that the true backbone of a smooth deployment is a secure SSH setup. While Astro makes building your site a breeze (and Bun keeps your dependency management fun), the real art lies in configuring GitLab CI to deploy your site safely using **rsync over SSH**.

## Quick Overview of the Astro Build Process

Astro‚Äôs ability to generate blazing-fast static sites is one of its biggest draws. With a clean build process, Astro outputs all your static files (typically into a `dist` directory) that are ready to be deployed. In this setup, **Bun** is used for managing dependencies and executing the build, ensuring you get a production-ready site every time.

## Deep Dive into GitLab CI Deployment with SSH and rsync

### GitLab CI Pipeline Structure

Our pipeline is split into two main stages:
- **Build:** Generates the static files for your Astro site.
- **Deploy:** Transfers these files securely to your server using rsync over SSH.

Below is a snippet of our **GitLab CI YAML configuration** that outlines these stages:

```yaml wrap
# .gitlab-ci.yml
image: node:lts

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  # Customize these variables for your project
  BUILD_DIR: 'dist' # Replace with your Astro app's output directory if different

build:
  stage: build
  before_script:
    - npm install -g bun
  script:
    - bun install
    - bun run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - $BUILD_DIR

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  before_script:
    - eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    - echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" | tr -d '\r' | ssh-add -
    - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    - chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    - ssh-keyscan $SSH_HOST >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    - chmod 644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y rsync
  script:
    - rsync -avz -e "ssh -p $SSH_PORT" $BUILD_DIR/ $SSH_USER@$SSH_HOST:$DEPLOY_DIR
  only:
    - main # Deploy only from the main branch

```

### Setting Up SSH in the Deploy Stage

The deploy stage is where security really comes into play. Here's how we secure our deployment:

- **Starting the ssh-agent:**  
  The ssh-agent is initiated to manage our SSH keys securely within the CI environment.
  
- **Securely Adding the SSH Key:**  
  We pull the private key from an environment variable (`SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`) and use `tr` to fix any potential issues with line endings. This ensures our key is correctly formatted for use.

- **Configuring the SSH Environment:**  
  By creating the `~/.ssh` directory with proper permissions and populating the `known_hosts` file using `ssh-keyscan`, we make sure that the remote server is trusted before any file transfer occurs.

- **Security Best Practices:**  
  Keeping our SSH keys and host data secure is paramount. This setup not only protects your deployment process but also helps prevent unauthorized access.

<Note>**‚òùÔ∏è Good To Know:** You of course can use this technique to also deploy static sites from GitHub Actions.</Note>

### Leveraging rsync Over SSH for Deployment

With SSH securely configured, rsync becomes a powerful tool to transfer your static files. The command:

```shell wrap
# .gitlab-ci.yml
rsync -avz -e "ssh -p $SSH_PORT" $BUILD_DIR/ $SSH_USER@$SSH_HOST:$DEPLOY_DIR
```

- **Uses environment variables** to ensure that sensitive details (like the server address and port) aren‚Äôt hardcoded.
- **Transfers files securely** over the established SSH connection.
- **Keeps the deployment process efficient** and reliable.

### Caution: Avoiding the `--delete` Option with Apache

While rsync‚Äôs `--delete` option is handy for mirroring directories by removing files not present in the source, it can be dangerous‚Äîespecially when your server runs Apache. Apache might have extra files (like logs, `.htaccess` files, or other dynamic content) that are essential for proper operation. Accidentally deleting these can cause major issues.

<Note>**‚òùÔ∏è Good To Know:** When deploying to Apache, steer clear of the `--delete` option unless you are absolutely sure of what you're mirroring and have backups in place.</Note>

Always test your rsync commands in a staging environment before pushing to production. A cautious approach ensures that you don‚Äôt inadvertently remove critical files that keep your web server running smoothly.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we‚Äôve seen that while Astro and Bun make building your site enjoyable, the real challenge lies in deploying it securely. By setting up GitLab CI with a robust SSH configuration and using rsync for file transfers, you can deploy your static site with confidence. Remember, a secure SSH setup is the backbone of your deployment process‚Äîespecially when using sensitive commands like rsync. And if your server runs Apache, think twice before using the `--delete` option.

Deploy confidently, and happy coding! üßë‚Äçüíª
