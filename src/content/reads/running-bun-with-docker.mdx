I find myself coming back to Bun more and more lately for running scripts and side projects. It's fast, has great DX, and is a joy to work with. For a recent project I wanted to deploy a Bun app inside a Docker container. Here's what I learned.

## Running Bun in Alpine Linux

When building production Docker images, you often want to use a minimal base image to keep the image size small. Alpine Linux is a popular choice for this because it's lightweight and secure.

Like many Docker repositories, [oven/bun](https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun/) also provides an image based on Alpine. So you don't have to create your own docker file from scratch and can use the official bun docker image as a base image for your own Dockerfile.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM bun:1-alpine
```

<Note>**üî• Hot Tip:** Use a fixed version tag like `1.1.10-alpine` instead of `latest` to ensure reproducibility and avoid unexpected changes in your production environment. Then use tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to keep your images up to date.</Note>

## The Dockerfile

You will probably want to have a build stage in your Dockerfile to create a production build of your Bun application. While bundle size is not as critical on the server as it is in the browser, you still want to get performance optimizations, environment-specific behavior (like logging or error handling), and also take advantage of tree-shaking and minification.  
Have you ever pushed a bloated Docker image over Wi-Fi to Docker Hub? It's not fun. üêå

### Multi-stage Dockerfile

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# Build stage
FROM bun:1-alpine as build
```
