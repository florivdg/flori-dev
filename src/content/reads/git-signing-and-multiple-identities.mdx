Working with multiple Git identities‚Äîespecially when balancing personal and professional repositories‚Äîcan be cumbersome if not handled properly. Fortunately, Git provides straightforward ways to maintain distinct identities and securely sign commits using SSH.

## Organizing Your Project Directories

First things first: organize your repositories clearly. Create separate directories to distinguish between your work-related and personal projects:

- `~/Work` for professional projects.
- `~/Projects` for personal endeavors.

Ensure you also update paths in VS Code and shell aliases to reflect these directories.

## Configuring Conditional Git Identities

Git supports conditional configurations, allowing automatic switching between identities based on the directory context.

### Step 1: Create a Work-Specific Git Config

Make a separate config file (`~/.gitconfig-work`) dedicated to work-related repositories:

```ini
[user]
  name  = Your Work Name
  email = you@company.example.com
```

### Step 2: Conditionally Include the Work Config

Edit your main `~/.gitconfig` to include your work-specific configuration conditionally:

```ini
[user]
  name  = Your Personal Name
  email = you@personal.example.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/Work/"]
  path = ~/.gitconfig-work
```

With this setup, Git automatically applies your work identity whenever you operate within the `~/Work` directory, and defaults to your personal identity elsewhere.

## Commit Signing with SSH Keys

Why SSH instead of GPG? Simplicity and convenience. Using SSH keys for commit signing streamlines the process significantly.

### Generate a Dedicated SSH Signing Key

Create an SSH key specifically for signing your commits:

```shell wrap
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/git_commit_signing -C "commit-signing@yourdomain"
```

### Configure Git to Sign Commits

Edit your global Git configuration to enable commit signing with the newly generated SSH key:

```ini
[commit]
  gpgSign = true
[user]
  signingKey = ~/.ssh/git_commit_signing
[gpg]
  format = ssh
```

This single signing key simplifies your commit signing workflow across both personal and professional repositories.

## Adding Your Signing Key to GitHub and GitLab

To ensure your commits show as "Verified" on GitHub and GitLab:

1. Copy your public SSH signing key:

```shell
cat ~/.ssh/git_commit_signing.pub
```

2. Add this key to your GitHub and GitLab account settings under "SSH Keys" or "Signing Keys."

<Note>
  **‚òùÔ∏è Good To Know:** You can use separate keys for SSH authentication
  (push/pull) and commit signing to enhance security.
</Note>

## Locally Verify Your Signed Commits (Optional)

To verify your commits locally:

### Step 1: Create an Allowed-Signers File

Define the allowed signers in `~/.config/git/allowed_signers`:

```text wrap
you@company.example.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3...
you@personal.example.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3...
```

### Step 2: Configure Git to Recognize the Allowed Signers File

Add the following to your global Git config:

```ini
[gpg "ssh"]
  allowedSignersFile = ~/.config/git/allowed_signers
```

### Step 3: Verify Commits

Use this command to confirm commit verification:

```shell
git log --show-signature
```

Your commits should now display clearly as signed and verified.

## Conclusion

By leveraging conditional Git configurations and SSH for signing, you simplify identity management and enhance security. Whether collaborating professionally or working on personal projects, this method ensures clear distinctions between your identities and keeps your commits trustworthy.

Happy coding! üöÄ
