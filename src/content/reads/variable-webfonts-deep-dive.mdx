It all started with me wanting to use a new font on my website. While the good old system fonts that come as the default Tailwind CSS families are great, I wanted something more unique.

After looking around for a while, I stumbled upon [GitHub's Mona Sans](https://github.com/mona-sans) and really liked it. It was open source, free to use, and looked great. I currently use their [Monaspace Font](https://monaspace.githubnext.com) in my IDEs, so I thought the two together would be a great match for my site.

Also, they are both variable glyph fonts. So now I had a great opportunity to learn more about variable fonts and how to use them on the web. Something I have wanted to do for a long time...

## What are Variable Fonts?

Variable fonts utilize a single font file to encapsulate a range of type variations through the use of axes such as width, weight, and slant.

The **width axis** allows for adjustment from condensed to expanded characters, affecting the horizontal stretch without altering the font size. The **weight axis** controls the thickness of the strokes, enabling transitions from light to bold. The **slant axis** modifies the angle of the letters, offering variations from upright to italic.

These axes can be finely adjusted via CSS, giving developers precise control over typography without the need for multiple font files, streamlining web typography with a focus on technical efficiency and flexibility.

So instead of having to choose between `font-weight: 400;` and `font-weight: 500;` you can now simply use `font-weight: 450;` and get the exact weight if that fits your design better. This also allows for smoother transitions between different character styles.
