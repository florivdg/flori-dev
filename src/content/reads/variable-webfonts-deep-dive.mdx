It all started with me wanting to use a new font on my website. While the good old system fonts that come as the default Tailwind CSS families are great, I wanted something more unique.

After looking around for a while, I stumbled upon [GitHub's Mona Sans](https://github.com/mona-sans) and really liked it. It was open source, free to use, and looked great. I currently use their [Monaspace Font](https://monaspace.githubnext.com) in my IDEs, so I thought the two together would be a great match for my site.

Also, they are both variable glyph fonts. So now I had a great opportunity to learn more about variable fonts and how to use them on the web. Something I have wanted to do for a long time...

## What are Variable Fonts?

Variable fonts use a single font file to encapsulate a range of font variations through the use of axes such as width, weight, and slant.

The **width axis** allows adjustment from condensed to expanded characters, affecting horizontal stretch without changing the font size. The **weight axis** controls the thickness of the strokes, allowing transitions from light to bold. The **slant axis** changes the angle of the letters, allowing variations from upright to italic.

These axes can be fine-tuned via CSS, giving developers precise control over typography without the need for multiple font files, streamlining web typography with a focus on technical efficiency and - *what I love the most* - flexibility.

For example, instead of having to choose between `font-weight: 400;` and `font-weight: 500;`, you can now simply use `font-weight: 444;` and get the exact weight if that better suits your design. This also allows for smoother transitions between different character styles.

## Setup with `@font-face`

As with "legacy" web fonts, variable fonts are loaded using the `@font-face` rule, too:

```css {6-8}
/* style.css */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Mona Sans';
  src: url('/fonts/Mona-Sans.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-display: swap;
  font-weight: 200 900;
  font-stretch: 75% 125%;
  font-style: oblique -11deg 0deg;
}
```

In the code example above, I have highlighted the `font-weight` and `font-stretch` properties because they are the most important when working with variable fonts. These properties define the range of font variations available to the browser.

In our example, Mona Sans has a weight range from `200` to `900` and a stretch range from `75%` to `125%`.

The same is true for the `font-style` property. It defines the range of the slant axis of the font. In our example, the range is from `-11deg` to `0deg`. The `oblique` value tells the browser to use the slant axis instead of an italic version of the font.

## Accessing Font Variations

As with any other font, you now set the desired font family and style in your CSS:

```css
/* style.css */
.variable-font {
  font-family: 'Mona Sans', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 888;
  font-stretch: 90%;
  font-size: 6rem;
}
```

And this is what it looks like:
