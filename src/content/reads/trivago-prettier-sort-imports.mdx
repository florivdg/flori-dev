As your TypeScript projects grow, it's easy to lose track of your imports. Especially if you're working in a team, it's important to have a consistent way of importing modules. Prettier itself cannot help you keep them organized out of the box.

I tried several Prettier plugins I found on the web, but none of them really worked for me. But finally I found a solution that works for me and I want to share it with you.

## The Problem

As TypeScript projects become larger and teams grow, managing imports can quickly become a daunting task. It's essential to maintain a clean and organized structure to facilitate easier code maintenance and readability. While Prettier is a fantastic tool for code formatting, it doesn't inherently solve the challenge of organizing imports.

So as time goes by, your imports might end up looking like this:

```ts
# component.tsx
import { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { format, parseISO } from 'date-fns'
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'
import { XYZ } from 'library'
import { ABC as AliasABC } from 'another-library'
import HelperUtil from '../utils/HelperUtil'
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Button, TextInput } from 'my-ui-library'
import type { User, UserSettings } from '@/types'
import { fetchUser, updateUser } from '@/services/userService'
import { Toast } from '@/components/Toast'
import { useUserContext } from '@/contexts/UserContext'
import { Icon, Loader } from 'components'
import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'
import SomeLocalComponent from '../SomeLocalComponent'
import AnotherUtil from '../../utils/AnotherUtil'
import { Dialog } from '@/components/Dialog'
import { logError, logInfo } from '@/utils/logger'

```

## The Solution

After exploring various prettier plugins without success, I discovered a solution that effectively addresses this issue: the [`@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports) package. This plugin is a game-changer, offering a way to automatically sort import declarations in a consistent manner. By integrating this plugin into your development workflow, you can ensure that your imports are always neatly organized, following a specific order that you define.

### How to Configure Order and Separation

First, install the plugin using your favorite package manager.

Then, configure your `.prettierrc` file to specify the order in which you want your imports to be sorted. This customization is a powerful feature of the plugin, allowing you to tailor the import sorting to your project's specific needs.

```json
# .prettierrc
{
  "plugins": ["@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports"],
  "sortImports": true,
  "importOrder": ["^@core/(.*)$", "^@server/(.*)$", "^[./]"],
  "importOrderSeparation": true
}
```

In the example above the imports are going to be sorted in the following order:

1. All imports starting with `@core`
2. All imports starting with `@server`
3. All other imports

I especially like the `importOrderSeparation` flag which separates the import groups with an empty line. This makes the imports even more readable.

Then the imports will be sorted like this:

```ts
# sorted.tsx
import { ModuleA, ModuleB } from '@core/utils'

import { ServiceA, ServiceB } from '@server/services'

import ComponentA from './MyComponentA'
import ComponentB from '../MyComponentB'
import { helperFunction, anotherHelperFunction } from './utils'
import type { TypeA, TypeB } from './types'
```

For more detailed instructions and configuration options, refer to the [plugin's README](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports/blob/main/README.md).

## Usage with Astro

While I was integrating the plugin into a quite huge Vue.js TypeScript SPA project without any issues, I also wanted to use it in my personal Astro projects. Unfortunately, I had to find out that it's not quite working so for. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports/issues/210) for that. Let's hope this finds its way into the plugin soon.

### Conclusion

Keeping imports organized is crucial for maintaining clean code, especially in large TypeScript projects. The `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` provides a robust solution for automating this process, ensuring consistency across your codebase. Embrace this plugin to enhance your coding standards and streamline your development process.
