While Astro is awesome when it comes to build responsive images for static sites at built time, it lacks the flexibility needed for dynamic image processing in a SSR (server-side rendering) context. This is where [ipx](https://unjs.io/packages/ipx) comes in handy, providing a powerful image proxy that can be integrated as a middleware into your Astro project.

## The Problem: Image Optimization at Runtime

At my day job, we are currently working on a digital cafeteria menu system powered by Astro that requires real-time image processing capabilities. The challenge lies in dynamically resizing, converting formats, and optimizing images without pre-processing them at build time.

## ipx: On-Demand Image Processing

[ipx](https://unjs.io/packages/ipx) from the [UnJS ecosystem](https://unjs.io) is a powerful, high-performance image proxy service based on Sharp and libvips. It can be used as a standalone server or - like in this case - as middleware in your Astro project. ipx supports various image transformations such as resizing, cropping, format conversion, and more, all on-the-fly.

## Integrating ipx with Astro Middleware

Here's how you can quickly set up ipx as middleware within your Astro project:

### Middleware Configuration

First, configure your ipx server with filesystem storage:

```ts wrap {8-11,14-15}
# middleware.ts
import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware'
import { createipx, ipxFSStorage, createipxWebServer } from 'ipx'

const dir =
  process.env.ipx_IMAGES_DIR || new URL('../public/images', import.meta.url).pathname

// Create an ipx instance with filesystem storage
const ipx = createipx({
  storage: ipxFSStorage({ dir }),
  maxAge: 604800, // 7 days
})

// Create a web server for handling requests
const server = createipxWebServer(ipx)
```

### Handling Requests Using Web Standards

Your middleware should handle requests following standard web patterns:

```ts wrap {7}
# middleware.ts
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async ({ request }, next) => {
  const url = new URL(request.url)

  if (url.pathname.startsWith('/_ipx')) {
    const newUrl = new URL(url.pathname.replace('/_ipx', ''), request.url)
    return server(new Request(newUrl))
  }

  return next()
})
```

## Astro's Image Service Integration

By leveraging Astro's built-in Image Service API, you can seamlessly integrate ipx, automatically translating standard image attributes into ipx parameters.

### Creating a Custom Image Service

```ts
# ipx-image-service.ts
import type { ImageService, ImageTransform } from 'astro'

export class ipxImageService implements ImageService {
  getURL({ src, width, height, quality, format }: ImageTransform) {
    const params = [
      width && `w_${width}`,
      height && `h_${height}`,
      quality && `q_${quality}`,
      format && `f_${format}`,
    ].filter(Boolean)

    return `/_ipx/${params.join('/')}${src}`
  }

  // parseURL and getHTMLAttributes implementations here
}
```

Configure Astro to use this service in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js {6}
# astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

export default defineConfig({
  image: {
    service: { entrypoint: './src/utils/ipx-image-service.ts' },
  },
})
```

## Utilizing Astroâ€™s `<Image>` Component

Astro automatically handles the rest:

```astro title="hero.astro"
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import heroImage from '../assets/hero.jpg'
---

<Image
  src={heroImage}
  width={800}
  height={600}
  quality={90}
  format="webp"
  alt="Optimized Hero Image"
/>
```

This generates an ipx URL like:

```html
/_ipx/w_800/h_600/q_90/f_webp/assets/hero.jpg
```

## Responsive Images

Create responsive image sets dynamically for enhanced user experience:

```astro title="responsive.astro"
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import responsiveImage from '../assets/responsive.jpg'
---

<Image
  src={responsiveImage}
  widths={[400, 800, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
  format="webp"
  alt="Responsive Image"
/>
```

## Web Standards and Performance Benefits

Using standard HTTP request/response patterns ensures compatibility and leverages browser caching efficiently. The middleware adheres to RESTful URL patterns, significantly simplifying integration with CDNs.

## Conclusion

By combining ipx middleware with Astro's Image Service API, you get a pretty sweet setup for handling images dynamically. It's flexible, performs well, and makes the developer experience much smoother. Plus, sticking to web standards means everything just works together nicely - sometimes the simplest approach really is the best one.
