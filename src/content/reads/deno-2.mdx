This may not be the right question to ask, but I wanted to see what **Deno 2** brings to the table. I've been using **Bun** lately, and I love the whole experience of it. But for **mission critical applications**, Deno is still the better choice due to its majurity. But let's face it, Bun is way more fun. So let's dive into the current state of Deno and see if it's shinier than ever... or not. üßê

## What I Didn't Like about Deno

Back in the Deno 1.x days, it was my go-to JavaScript runtime when it came to **performance, stability and security**. I would always prefer it over Node.js for my mission critical applications. Seeing Deno powering **Supabase Edge Functions** was amazing and I liked their integration a lot. Deno was the runtime that I would **recommend to my colleagues**. But still, there were some things that I didn't like about Deno.

- Direct URL imports were **confusing** and **hard to maintain**.
- Handling dependency upgrades was **messy** and **time-consuming**.
- The ecosystem was **not mature enough** and a lot of packages were **missing**.
