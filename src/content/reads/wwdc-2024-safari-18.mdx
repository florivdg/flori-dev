On Monday at WWDC 2024, Apple announced Apple Intelligence, their - I think - really promising approach to personal AI built right into the iPhone and Mac. The reception seems to be really positive, as AAPL stock is skyrocketing (at least by Apple standards).

But, have you seen that you can now transition between `display` values in CSS? ðŸ¤¯ Let's have a look!

## Safari Has Been Crushing It Lately

Over the past few years, Safari has made great strides in implementing new features. Keeping up with the latest web standards and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with plain JavaScript and CSS. Things like CSS nesting, the `:has()` selector, or CSS Grid Level 3 (also known as "masonry" layout) are all in Safari - and often the WebKit team is the first to implement these features.

So if something ends up in Chrome and Safari, it's usually a good sign that it's a real thing and ready for production use.

## View Transitions ðŸŽ‰

This is my favorite new CSS feature to land in Chrome for quite some time now. But when it was *not* part of [Interop 2024] (https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024), I was a bit disappointed. But know it landed in Safari 18 and is already available in the Safari Technical Preview. Yeah! ðŸŽ‰

While this is technically Level 1 of View Transitions (transitioning within a SPA), it's a great start. Support for Level 2 (transitioning between different pages in MPAs - or as we used to call them: websites) has actually shipped in Chrome 126 this week. Awesome!

If you want to learn more about it, check out the news from Google I/O 2024 at [developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/view-transitions-update-io24).
