As a software and web developer, I know the pain of upgrading CLI tools like Node, Homebrew stuff, and others individually. To simplify this process, I've created a simple upgrade script, "Upgrade All The Things". And gave it a handy shell alias.

<Image

  alt="An adorably cute robot package manager"
  caption="An adorably cute robot package manager."
  lazy={false}
/>

## The Script

The script itself is just a simple shell script that runs the following commands:

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh

# Homebrew
brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup && brew doctor

# Source nvm
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

# Node
nvm install 19 --reinstall-packages-from=node --latest-npm

# Global npm packages
ncu -g

# corepack
corepack disable
```

### What's going on here?

The Homebrew stuff is pretty straightforward. For Node, I use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) as the version manager, so I have to load it before using it. Then I install the latest version of Node (which I have pinned to a specific version) and reinstall all global packages.

I also use [`ncu`](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates) to check for outdated global npm packages. Finally, I disable Corepack, because it messes up my `pnpm` installation from Homebrew (since Corepack does not always ship the latest version).

## Shell Alias

To make it easier to run the script, I've created a shell alias for it. I've added the following line to my `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
alias uatt="~/Scripts/upgrade-all-the-things.sh"
```
