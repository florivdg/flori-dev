  "alt": "A woman, dressed in a red top and black skirt with a backpack, walks hand-in-hand with a young child down a cobblestone alleyway. The entrance to a cozy bookstore is visible ahead, with bright, marquee-style letters spelling \"STORY\" illuminated above it. A chalkboard menu stands to the side, decorated artistically, while the interior of the bookstore is glimpsed, filled with colorful books and a welcoming ambiance. The scene captures a warm, inviting moment between the two as they approach the shop.",
