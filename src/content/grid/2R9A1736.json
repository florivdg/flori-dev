The habitat is equipped with tall, dead trees arranged to mimic a natural environment, complete with multiple ropes strung between them for the orangutans to climb and swing on. The backdrop includes a clear blue sky and a variety of greenery, including trees and shrubs, enhancing the sense of a tranquil, natural setting.",
