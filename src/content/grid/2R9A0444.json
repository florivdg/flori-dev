  "alt": "The scene captures a sunlit urban setting where a tall palm tree rises alongside a textured stone building. The palm's shadow stretches across the wall, creating a beautiful contrast against the warm stone. Windows adorned with decorative frames are visible in the upper part of the wall, while a street lamp and a banner hint at the area's cultural significance. The clear blue sky overhead completes the tranquil atmosphere.",
