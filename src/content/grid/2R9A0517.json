In the foreground, a young boy dressed in a yellow shirt walks along a wide, paved path, with several pigeons in flight nearby. The background features a mix of pedestrians, including individuals of varied attire, while historic buildings with ornate rooftops rise against a clear blue sky. This lively atmosphere is enhanced by the scattering of pigeons on the ground and in the air, creating a harmonious blend of human and wildlife activities.",
