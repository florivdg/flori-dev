  "alt": "A young man and woman engaged in a conversation outside a café named 'Narciso'. The woman, wearing a black tank top and denim shorts, is seated on a stool, while the man, dressed in a black t-shirt and orange cap, is perched casually on another stool. The entrance of the café is framed by stone walls, with a welcoming sign in Spanish that invites patrons in. A warm ambiance is suggested by the dim lighting visible through large windows behind them, with potted plants adding a touch of greenery to the scene.",
