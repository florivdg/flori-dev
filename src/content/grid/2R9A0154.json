Silhouetted visitors are scattered throughout the exhibit, some standing and others in motion, engaging with the displays. A large, vintage locomotive model is prominently displayed in the center, brightly lit and serving as the focal point. To the right, a well-lit enclosure showcases model trains on tracks. Explanatory text panels are visible throughout, softly illuminated, inviting viewers to learn. The ambient lighting casts a soft glow on the sleek museum floors, creating a reflective surface that enhances the ambiance.",
