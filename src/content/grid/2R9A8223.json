  "alt": "Two small children are walking away from the camera, hand in hand, on a dirt path amid a wooded area. It appears to be winter, as light snowflakes fall around them. The child on the left wears a gray jacket, yellow pants, and a helmet with colorful patterns, while the child on the right dons a white jacket with animal prints, black pants, and a matching white hood. The scene exudes a peaceful and endearing quality.",
