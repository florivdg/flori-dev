  "alt": "A woman walks hand in hand with two young children in an urban street, sunlight streaming down on them. The woman wears a rust-colored top and a black, flowy skirt, while her hair is styled with a colorful scarf. The older child, a girl with blonde hair, wears a light pink t-shirt and dark shorts, holding the womanâ€™s hand. The younger child, a boy, is dressed in a gray striped shirt and light pants. In the background, there are street signs, a pedestrian crossing signal, and a blurred view of a car and buildings lining the street.",
