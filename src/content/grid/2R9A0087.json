  "alt": "This image captures an interior pathway with red and blue neon lighting. The walls and ceiling are lined with evenly spaced, vertical metallic bars, creating a dramatic pattern of parallel lines that converge in the perspective. The floor appears to be a smooth, dark surface that reflects the vibrant colors, enhancing the geometric visual. At the end of the corridor, silhouettes of people can be seen, suggesting the pathway is part of a larger, active public space.",
