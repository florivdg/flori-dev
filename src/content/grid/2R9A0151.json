The model is identified as '23 001' marked on the locomotive's front, with the 'DB' logo on the front. The setting appears to be an exhibition with carefully directed lighting highlighting the train model and creating a reflective surface below it. In the background there are informational displays and subdued lighting, suggesting an indoor museum environment.",
